\section{Conclusive Statement}

From the product being built to the math behind the magic to how Therabot works, we can conclude successfully that we have stepped into a new field with respect to the marriage of mental wellness and artificial intelligence, where we can now use robotic speech and personalized speech generation to cater to the user and create a more lasting bond.

The stigma around depression and getting help from a medical professional is still very high, and we believe that with the ease of access to a personalized robotic therapist in your smartphones/laptops, it should make it much more easier to approach the concept of getting help. Through the course of marketing the idea, we noticed that a lot of people were open about the idea of talking to a non-human person about their feelings as opposed to a stranger.

We believe that with the right amount of question-answer datasets and user input, along with the prolonged reinforcement learning in place, we will be able to build a self-sustaining chatbot that can help at least the majority of people who are in need of a person to talk to.
